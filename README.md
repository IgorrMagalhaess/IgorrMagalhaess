# 👋 Hello, I'm Igor!

I'm a passionate developer with experience in building robust applications and a strong focus on backend development. I enjoy learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. I was born and raised in Minas Gerais, Brazil and now live in Atlanta - Georgia, USA.


## About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in micro-service architecture and cloud computing.
- 💻 My favorite technologies include **Ruby on Rails**, **Django**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.
- 🔭 I’ve recently won a competition with my team for an app called **Brain Food**, which helps users track their mood and discover new recipes to improve and/or stabilize said mood.
- 👯‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve backend development and integration of APIs, but I'm also looking for opportunities where I can improve my Front End skills.
- 🚀 I’m also working on an app to support my parents' business by optimizing the logistics of dumpster locations for construction.
